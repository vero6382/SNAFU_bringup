# SNAFU_bringup

Currently still work in progress...

Finished collecting data for dmm and dconv -- need to look into dmv a bit more (inconclusive as of 3/6/24)

## TLDR
### dmm
max MOPS = 113.84

max GOPS/W = 14.231

### dconv
max MOPS = 216.3

max GOPS/W = 23.942

## How to Graph:
go into the {test_name} directory, and run 
`python3 graph.py`

example for graphing dmm results : `cd dmm ; python3 graph.py`
